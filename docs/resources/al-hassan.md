## Digitally Derived Evidence (DDE)

**Type of DDE, where was it obtained and by whom?**

1.  CDs with maps were collected[^69] and can be found in the Prosecution's confidential Annex.[^70]

2.  Call data records ("CDRs") submitted by the Prosecutor into evidence, can also be found in the Prosecution's confidential Annex.[^71] These CDRs are related to mobile phone numbers used in and around Timbuktu at the time relevant to the charges.[^72] Expert witnesses (P-0587 and P-0617) used them to produce graphics to illustrate the communications between various phone numbers attributed to several members of the Groups in and around Timbuktu at the time of the occupation of the city by the Groups.[^73] They also specifically looked at the activity of a phone number known to be used by the accused for the entire period of the occupation as well as on specific dates of relevant incidents.[^74]

3.  In this case, a DVD containing tables was also created.[^75]It can be found in the Prosecution's confidential Annex.[^76]

4.  Photographs were also important DDE collated. 80 photographs were shown to witness P-0114, which he commented on in his prior recorded testimony. [^77] Similarly, 32 photographs were shown to witness P-0595 during his interview.[^78] 33 photographs were used for identification purposes. The photographs were submitted by the Prosecution and Prosecution stated that Witness P-0639 identified individuals in seven of these photographs (described as persons of interest).[^79]

5.  4 videos were submitted by the Prosecution.[^80] The videos were shown to witness P-0639 by the Prosecution investigators (during the interview).[^81]16 videos or video extracts were submitted by the Prosecution in addition to the transcripts and translations that accompany the videos or video extracts.[^82] They were shown to witness P-0125 and discussed in his statement.[^83] The videos are related to the destruction of mausoleums and mosques \[rest of sentence is redacted\].[^84] The witness recognised some of the individuals, objects and/or locations mentioned in his Statement in videos or extracts shown.[^85]

## Court Analysis and Legal Submissions on DDE

**What arguments/findings were the DDE used to support?**

**The reasoning of the court with respect to DDE**

**Was the DDE admitted and/or relied upon?**

**Legal Submissions on DDE**

6.  **The CD with maps was admitted without discussion and it was not objected by the Defence.**

7.  With regards to the admission of the CDR's, the Chamber concluded that matters raised by the Defence do not prevent the submission of the evidence at this stage.[^86] The Chamber was of the view that the concerns raised by the Defence (i.e. experts capacity to testify on the authenticity and reliability of the data and local variables) can be duly addressed in the cross-examination, which remains unaffected.[^87] The Chamber was of the view that it is through technical experts (such as P-0587 and P-0617) that such data becomes legible for the purpose of trial proceedings.[^88] The Chamber decided that matters raised by the Defence do not prevent the submission of the said items. It stated that at this stage in line with the approach taken by the Chamber in its Directions on the conduct of proceedings, adopting a system that recognises submission of items of evidence 'without a prior ruling on relevance and/or admissibility' and considering 'relevance and probative value as part of the holistic assessment of all evidence submitted when deciding on the guilt or innocence of the accused.[^89]

8.  **The DVD evidence** was admitted without discussion as it was not objected by the Defence.[^90]

9.  The submission of 80 photographs was authorised following the application under "Rule 68(3) \[...\] in respect of P-0114" and they were added into the submission of the associated material.[^91] Regarding the set of 80 photographs, the Chamber found that the objections made by the Defence "refer more to the weight to be given to the photographs and P-0114's comments on them. The Chamber is of the view that these issues can be addressed by the Defence in its cross-examination, which remains unaffected by introduction of this material through Rule 68(3) of the Rules. Thus, the matters raised by the Defence do not prevent the submission of the said items at this stage. This is in line with the approach taken by the Chamber in its Directions on the conduct of proceedings, adopting a system that recognises submission of items of evidence 'without a prior ruling on relevance and/or admissibility' and considering 'relevance and probative value as part of the holistic assessment of all evidence submitted when deciding on the guilt or innocence of the accused'".[^92] The same reasoning was used in relation to the other sets of photographs.

10. The submission of 32 photographs was authorised by the Chamber citing the application under "Rule 68(3) \[...\] in respect of P-0595" and they were added into the submission of the associated material.[^93] Regarding the set of 32 photographs, the "Chamber considers the matters raised by the Defence (i.e. that the witness statement is confusing) refer more to the weight to be given to P-0595's testimony. The Chamber is of the view that these issues can be addressed by the Defence in its cross-examination, which remains unaffected. Moreover, the matters raised by the Defence do not prevent the submission of the said items at this stage. This is in line with the approach taken by the Chamber in its Directions on the conduct of proceedings, adopting a system that recognises submission of items of evidence 'without a prior ruling on relevance and/or admissibility' and considering 'relevance and probative value as part of the holistic assessment of all evidence submitted when deciding on the guilt or innocence of the accused'".[^94]

11. Regarding the submission of the set of 33 photographs, the Chamber granted "the Rule 68(3) Application in respect of P-0639" and authorized the submission of the associated material.[^95] Regarding the set of 33 photographs, the Chamber considered that the objections raised by the Defence refer more to the weight to be given to the associated material and the witnesses' (P-0639) comments to them. The Chamber was of the view that these issues can be addressed by the Defence in its cross-examination, which remains unaffected.[^96]

12. Regarding the set of 4 videos, the Chamber decided that the matters raised by the Defence do not prevent the submission of the items at this stage in line with the approach taken by the Chamber in its Directions on the conduct of proceedings.[^97] Regarding the set of 4 videos, the Chamber considered that the objections raised by the Defence refer more to the weight to be given to the associated material and the witnesses' (P-0639) comments to them. The Chamber was of the view that these issues can be addressed by the Defence in its cross-examination, which remains unaffected.[^98]

13. Regarding the set of 16 videos or video extracts, the Chamber authorized the introduction into evidence of the prior recorded testimony (of P-0125) and the 16 videos or video extracts (associated material).[^99] Regarding the set of 16 videos or video extracts, the Chamber considered that in the absence of specific reasons not to do so, the associated material identified by the Prosecution can be introduced into evidence via this witness pursuant to Rule 68(2)(c).[^100] The Chamber was not convinced by the Defence's argument. It noted that the witness (P-0125) was presented all the associated material submitted and that he discussed, at least to a certain extent, their content.[^101] The Chamber stated that the absence of cross-examination, which is due to the witness's unavailability, is a factor which will be considered by the Chamber in its ultimate assessment of the probative value and weight, if any, to be attributed to this evidence.[^102] The Chamber also fails to see how the fact that certain material was not sought to be introduced by the Prosecution, because the witness did not recognise persons or places, is prejudicial, noting that, should it wish to do so, the Defence can itself seek to have it introduced into evidence or seek to have admitted other related evidence.[^103]

14. In addition to the findings abovementioned, the Court also established general rules regarding the use of audio-video materials. Since this is not related to a particular type of DDE, but the Court's sayings are relevant to the research conducted, the discussions are presented in this section of the case summary. The Chamber stated that "If parties or participants wish to present audio-visual material to a witness, they must establish the relevance of this exercise, for example that the witness has personal knowledge of the making of the recording or its contents. This may be achieved by playing a brief excerpt of the audio-visual material to the extent strictly necessary, and without sound where appropriate, for the witness to confirm his/her personal knowledge of it. Once this has occurred, the party or participant may play the excerpt(s) of the recording it intended to present to the witness".[^104] Additionally, the Chamber determined that "In principle, video or audio recordings may only be used in court if a transcript, and translation if applicable, are available. The party or participant intending to use a video or audio recording shall indicate in its List of Material the sections of the transcript, if any, corresponding to the excerpts of the material it intends to use; as well as, if applicable, the corresponding sections of the translation". [^105]

## Rules of Evidence

15. Rule 68(2)(c) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence: "If the witness who gave the previously recorded testimony is not present before the Trial Chamber, the Chamber may allow the introduction of that previously recorded testimony in any one of the following instances: (c) The prior recorded testimony comes from a person who has subsequently died, must be presumed dead, or is, due to obstacles that cannot be overcome with reasonable diligence, unavailable to testify orally. In such a case: (i) Prior recorded testimony falling under sub-rule (c) may only be introduced if the Chamber is satisfied that the person is unavailable as set out above, that the necessity of measures under article 56 could not be anticipated, and that the prior recorded testimony has sufficient indicia of reliability. (ii) The fact that the prior recorded testimony goes to proof of acts and conduct of an accused may be a factor against its introduction, or part of it."

16. Rule 68(3) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence: "If the witness who gave the previously recorded testimony is present before the Trial Chamber, the Chamber may allow the introduction of that previously recorded testimony if he or she does not object to the submission of the previously recorded testimony and the Prosecutor, the defence and the Chamber have the opportunity to examine the witness during the proceedings."

## Extrapolations

### Call Data Records ('CDRs') Intercepted Radio Communications

17. The Chamber decided that the experts' capacity to testify on the authenticity and reliability of the CDRs, as part of materials relied on in their report, can be addressed in the cross-examination.[^106] The Chamber noted that it is through technical experts that the data becomes legible for the purpose of trial proceedings, against the Defence's argument that the CDRs are unintelligible without further analysis.[^107] The Chamber adopted in an earlier decision a system that recognises submission of items of evidence without a prior ruling on the relevance and probative value as it will be part of the holistic assessment of all evidence submitted when deciding on the guilt or innocence of the accused.[^108] Thus, the Defence's arguments did not prevent the submission at this stage.[^109]

### Photographs

18. The Chamber considered that the objections raised by the Defence, that it cannot be introduced via Rule 68(3) of the Rules because the witness did not author some items or did not recognise individuals shown to him in photos, can be addressed by the Defence in its cross-examination.[^110] The Chamber also decided that the matters raised by the Defence do not prevent the submission of the items at this stage is in line with the approach taken by the Chamber in its Directions on the conduct of proceedings (a holistic assessment of all evidence submitted when deciding on the guilt or innocence of the accused).[^111]

### Videos

19. The Chamber decided that the issue raised by the Defence, namely the weight to be given to the materials, can be addressed by the Defence in its cross-examination.[^112] The Chamber decided that the matters raised by the Defence do not prevent the submission of the items at this stage in line with the approach taken by the Chamber in its Directions on the conduct of proceedings (a holistic assessment of all evidence submitted when deciding on the guilt or innocence of the accused).[^113]

20. The Chamber considered that in the absence of specific reasons not to do so, videos, as part of the associated material identified by the Prosecution, can be introduced into evidence via this witness pursuant to Rule 68(2)(c).[^114] The Chamber stated that the absence of cross-examination, which is due to the witness's unavailability, is a factor which will be considered by the Chamber in its ultimate assessment of the probative value and weight to be attributed to the videos.[^115] The Chamber stated that the fact that certain material was not sought to be introduced by the Prosecution, because the witness did not recognise persons or places in them is not prejudicial, noting that, should the Defence wish to do so, it can seek to have it introduced into evidence or seek to have admitted other related evidence.[^116]

### Audio-visual materials

21. The relevance of showing audio-visual material to a witness during the trial must be established beforehand (e.g. the witness has personal knowledge of the making of the recording or its contents).[^117]

22. Video or audio recordings may only be used in court if a transcript, and translation if applicable, are available. [^118]
