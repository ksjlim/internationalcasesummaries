# Leiden Guidelines on the Use of Digitally Derived Evidence in International Criminal Courts and Tribunals

The KGF research project on ‘Digitally Derived Evidence’ examines the different legal standards of evidence applicable at various national and international accountability fora in order to prosecute international crimes. The project was initiated in 2019 by Dr. Emma Irving and KGF Director Dr. Robert Heinsch and offered the opportunity for Leiden IHL Clinic students to contribute to the research. Find out more about the research project [here](http://kalshovengieskesforum.com/dde-project/).

This research project makes use of the expertise and infrastructure of both the [Kalshoven-Gieskes Forum on International Humanitarian Law](http://kalshovengieskesforum.com/) and its IHL Clinic as well as the [Grotius Centre for International Legal Studies](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/law/institute-of-public-law/grotius-centre) at Leiden University. The research is funded by the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA), Switzerland.
